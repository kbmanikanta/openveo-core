# Introduction

OpenVeo core doesn't have many features on its own. Plugins are made to add functionalities to your OpenVeo. OpenVeo core loads all plugins found in **node_modules/@openveo/** (plugins maintained by the OpenVeo team) or **node_modules/openveo-*** (community plugins) when starting the process.

Community plugins can be found on [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com).

# Write a plugin

To write your own OpenVeo plugin you should use the [OpenVeo Plugin Generator](https://github.com/veo-labs/openveo-plugin-generator) to automatically create the skeleton of your plugin.
All documentation needed to implement your plugin is available on the [OpenVeo Plugin Generator](https://github.com/veo-labs/openveo-plugin-generator) project.
